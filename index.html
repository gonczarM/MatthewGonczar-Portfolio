				<p><a href="https://allo-web.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Allo's</a> website link, the application may take longer to initially load due to Heroku's server sleep mode</p>
				<p>Allo is an instant translation messaging app. Each user can have their recieved messages translated to a preffered language. It completes these translations using IBMs Watson Language Translator API.</p>
				<p>The back end was built using Node.js, express, and MongoDB. The front end was created using the ReactJS library.</p>
				<p>Check out the front end GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/gumballg/Allo-React">here</a> and the back end <a href="https://github.com/gumballg/Allo-Backend">here</a></p>

				</form>
				<p><a href="https://gumballg.github.io/Legend-of-Link/" target="_blank">Legend of Link's</a> website link</p>
				<p>This was the first project I was able to build using only JavaScript. I grew up playing many iterations of Legend of Zelda and wanted to emulate it. This game lets you control and move Link around the map. You share the map with many ghosts that will attack when you cross their path. You can, however, try and defeat the enemies by swinging your sword at them.</p>
				<p>Legend of Link was created using canvas, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</p>

				<p><a href="https://greg-list.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Greg's List's</a> website link, the application may take longer to initially load due to Heroku's server sleep mode</p>
				<p>Collaborated to develop a coders CriagsList, where users can sign up to create job postings, events, and upload their own résumé. Users can get in contact with other users by sending an email through the website.</p>
				<p>We built this as a full stack app using Node.js, express, and MongoDB, and EJS</p>

			<div class="story">
				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program. I live here in the wonderful windy city of Chicago. My older brother and I share an apartment in the beautiful little neighborhood of Pilsen. If I'm not working on perfecting a doubled linked list, you can find me enjoying one of the many amazing things do here. This city may be great but I would enjoy collaborating with other devs from any area, as long as we're building something to be excited about. I've been living here for almost two years, sadly leaving behind my parents back in Michigan. Even with eight older siblings spanned around the entire world we always find time to get together. I am excited to strengthen my skills through my projects and with the ever changing technology of Software Engineering.</p>
